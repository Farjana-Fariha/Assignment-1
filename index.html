            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable disases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and idustrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet</p>

            <p>Hi I am Farjana Fariha. One of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever got! Kitchen makeover (includes your fridge and pantry) is essential if you want to eat healthily. No matter how much self-control you have, if you have unhealthy food stashed in your fridge or kitchen cabinets, you will end up eating it. So, toss out the unhealthy foods and re-stock with healthy foods. </p>

                <p>Southerners have a lot of expressions to relay their dislike of the summer's heat. "Hotter'n blue blazes" and "hotter than the hinges on the gates of Hades" are two I always remember hearing in my childhood. But there's another truth about the South in the summer: It's one of the most delicious places to be. As gardens come into peak ripeness and farmers' markets fill up with produce, the South is a really special place to be</p>

                <p>Soup is winter's answer to salad. And while the super creamy ones that come in a bread bowl taste amazing, they won't help any healthy eating goals. When you're trying to stick to a diet but need a nice, warm bowl of broth, these hearty and healthy soups will fill you up.

                <h1>Chicken Keema Idli</h1>
                <p>We love a giant grain salad that is full of so many beautiful things! This farro and white bean salad has roasted veggies along with crunchy veggies like bell pepper and radicchio. It's all tossed in a bright lemony dressing and finished with some goat cheese to add the creamy tanginess. It's as flavorful as it is beautiful and we can't get enough of it. It takes well to substitutions and add-ins as well. Use some cabbage instead of radicchio or spinach instead of arugula.</p>
